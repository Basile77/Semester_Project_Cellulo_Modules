# Semester_Project_Cellulo_Modules
Here is the code associated with the Semester Project at CHILI lab : Development of modules for the Cellulo robot

I've made 3 different modules, a Screen module, a Sound module, and a motor one.
the first two are mainly used for communication while the last one is more a rehabilitation module.

The screen module has 2 implementation, one using a LCD color screen, the other one with an OLED grayscale one.

In each folder is a implementation basic functions that can be used to create more complex application.

I hope everything is clear.
